Key idea: The promoters of Agentin Engineering Systems undersell the complexities of using these systems for serious production work and not throwaway weekend projects/simple crud apps/mvps etc.

They sell u do dream of building anything easily in no time from a single PRD doc just by directing a fleet of parallel agents. recipe for catasthrope.

Real projects cannot be done from a single PRD. it has to be broken down. it has stakeholders, managers, multiple teams that require coordination.

Yet building an agentic system for this use case is highly possible, it jsut takes time.

U cannot start from a final system, u have to build it up along your project.

The problem with Agentic Engineering Systems promoted like Cole Medins, Gas town etc

- Too much trust in LLM capacity. the system is not tiered - it goes to the full-blown agentic parallal jarvis scifi way (probably for hype generation). no manual fallback. not composable. only the full pipeline.
  the whole thinking is backwards

- LLM capacity need verification. In real projects, trust evolves over time. u start simple, manual with skills. u refine the skill instructions over time to your sytem/project.

- then with the strong skills foundation & integrations in place(project management, mcps etc) in place, you can run a dev-cycle for a SINGLE task. simple tasks first. edge cases will pile up. process has to be refined. continuous effort.

- once ur dev-cycle is solid. Then u can think about parallel execution of tasks. for this u need a new layer that handles PR's merge conflicts etc. this is serious effort to get it right again. will take time and experimentation
