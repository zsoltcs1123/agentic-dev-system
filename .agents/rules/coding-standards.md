# Coding Standards

## Principles

- SOLID: Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion
- DRY: Don't repeat yourself
- KISS: Keep it simple
- YAGNI: You aren't gonna need it

## Naming

- Use descriptive, meaningful names
- Be consistent with existing codebase conventions
- Avoid abbreviations unless domain-standard

## Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly
- Fail fast, fail clearly
- Provide actionable error messages

## Anti-patterns

- God classes/functions: Split into focused units
- Magic numbers/strings: Use named constants
- Deep nesting: Extract to functions or early returns
